# Content Style Guide

**Length:** 2–3 sentences (max 350–400 characters).  
**Tone:** useful, clear, friendly, no fluff.  
**Language:** plain English, avoid jargon.  
**Format:**

1. First sentence: main insight or fact.
2. Second: practical advice or example.
3. Optional third: nuance or caution.

**Do not:** use clickbait, miracle claims, or more than one emoji.

**Example (Nutrition):**  
"If you’re rushing breakfast, pair protein and fiber (yogurt + fruit + nuts). It keeps you full longer and helps you avoid mid-morning snacks."
